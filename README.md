# Extension Packager

## Description
This app is intended to repackage Chrome extensions to host them in their own webstore. This allows extensions to be installed on computers that are not allowed to connect to the Chrome Web Store for security reasons. Users can download the extension themselves. Alternatively, the administrator can assign the extensions to the users and retains control over the installed extension version.

The application is based on WinUI 3.

## Features
The following functions are offered by the application or are planned.
  - Converting the CRX file into a ZIP file (source: [crxviewer](https://github.com/Rob--W/crxviewer) from [Rob Wu](https://github.com/Rob--W))
  - Reading and modifying the manifest file
  - Packaging the extension with a Chromium browser
  - Reading the extension ID (source: [crxviewer](https://github.com/Rob--W/crxviewer) from [Rob Wu](https://github.com/Rob--W))
  - Creating the XML manifest
  - Generating the string for use in a group policy
  - Managing the extensions in the defined output directory
